<p class="text-body">
    AfrikaBurn 2023... Invites you to embark on a journey through universes, to new worlds, through a glimmering wormhole
    and out the other side. Quaggafontein beckons with a circus in the stars, a field of imagination ripe for navigation and
    creation. Forge your own wonders, design cosmic delights and play with your weird and alien crew. This horizon beckons
    you. Breathe deep the night air, drink the moonlight moonshine. Stumble and play on our rocky orb, in the glow of our
    nearest star. Imagine all you can be and fall in love with all you are. AfrikaBurn is the spectacular result of the
    creative expression of participants who gather once a year in the Tankwa Karoo to create a temporary city of art, theme
    camps, costume, music and performance. Guided by 11 principles AfrikaBurn isn’t designed to be easy, it’s about radical
    preparation and self reliance, imagining, community and participation.
